# KafkaProject_Readme

For Kafka Project 2 repositories are there:-

1- delivery boy
2- enduser

deliveryboy will send the messages(in project we are sending the location) and the enduser (consumer) will consume the location.

This Project is a real time project which show the working of Swiggy/Zomato.

We are able to track the location of the delivery boy, using the google location. Kalfka has a very high through put, we can send thousands of messages at one go. So the server send the location co-ordinates every second and the listener is consuming it, due to which we can see the updated location every time.
